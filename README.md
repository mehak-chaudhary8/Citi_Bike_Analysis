# Citi-Bike

Citi Bike is NYCâ€™s official bike share program, designed to give residents and visitors a fun, affordable and convenient alternative to walking, taxis, buses and subways. There are over 1,700 Citi Bike stations and 27,000 bikes across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City, and Hoboken making Citi Bike the most accessible way to get around and explore NYC.

## Objective

Our objective is to conduct an in-depth examination, revealing significant trends within the dataset that shed light on crucial characteristics of our customer base and patterns in bike utilization.

## Data Set

I've taken the Data Set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanmcummings/citi-bike-data). The data set contains information about NYCitiBike's stations location as well as trip durations, cutomer gender and age and more.

I also took a NYC Zip-Code GeoJSON from GitHub - [NYC Geo JSON](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2015_EC/blob/master/mam1612_EC/nyc-zip-code-tabulation-areas-polygons.geojson).
